# DevOps: Overview, Lifecycle, and Comparison with SDLC & Agile

## **What is DevOps?**  
DevOps is a **culture, practice, and set of tools** that combines **software development (Dev)** and **IT operations (Ops)** to improve collaboration, automate processes, and deliver high-quality software faster.  

It breaks down silos between development and operations teams, enabling **continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), automation, and monitoring** throughout the software lifecycle.

## **DevOps Lifecycle**  
The DevOps lifecycle consists of **continuous stages** that ensure rapid and reliable software delivery:  

1. **Plan** – Define requirements, track progress (e.g., Jira, Trello).  
2. **Code** – Developers write code using version control (e.g., Git, GitHub).  
3. **Build** – Compile code into executable files (e.g., Maven, Gradle).  
4. **Test** – Automated testing for bugs (e.g., Selenium, JUnit).  
5. **Release** – Deploy to staging/production (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD).  
6. **Deploy** – Infrastructure provisioning (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible).  
7. **Operate** – Monitor and manage applications (e.g., Prometheus, Nagios).  
8. **Monitor** – Track performance and logs (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk).  

### **Key Concepts:**
- **Continuous Integration (CI)** – Frequent code merges & automated testing.  
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)** – Automatically deploy to production-like environments.  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)** – Fully automated production releases.

## **Why Companies Adopt DevOps?**  
✅ **Faster Time-to-Market** – Automation reduces manual work, speeding up releases.  
✅ **Improved Collaboration** – Breaks down silos between Dev & Ops.  
✅ **Higher Quality Software** – Automated testing catches bugs early.  
✅ **Scalability & Reliability** – Cloud & containers enable flexible scaling.  
✅ **Cost Efficiency** – Reduces downtime and manual errors.  
✅ **Better Customer Satisfaction** – Faster updates & stable performance.

## **SDLC vs Agile vs DevOps**  

| **Aspect**       | **SDLC (Waterfall)**       | **Agile**                     | **DevOps**                     |
|------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Approach**     | Linear, sequential phases | Iterative, incremental cycles | Continuous, automated pipeline |
| **Speed**        | Slow (Months/Years)       | Faster (Weeks)                | Fastest (Hours/Days)           |
| **Feedback**     | End of project            | After each sprint             | Real-time monitoring           |
| **Teams**        | Siloed (Dev vs Ops)       | Cross-functional (Dev + QA)   | Fully integrated (Dev + Ops)   |
| **Automation**   | Minimal                   | Partial (CI)                  | Full (CI/CD, IaC, Monitoring)  |
| **Risk**         | High (Late-stage issues)  | Medium (Iterative fixes)      | Low (Early detection)          |

### **Summary:**
- **SDLC (Waterfall)** – Rigid, slow, good for stable requirements.  
- **Agile** – Flexible, iterative, focuses on **development speed**.  
- **DevOps** – Extends Agile by **automating deployment & operations**.

## **Conclusion**  
- **DevOps = Culture + Automation + Collaboration**  
- **Lifecycle = Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor**  
- **Companies adopt DevOps for speed, quality, and efficiency**.  
- **SDLC is outdated, Agile improves Dev, DevOps enhances Dev + Ops together**.
